To win the game, you must survive from the zombies for 80-82 seconds.

The zombies will repeatedly come at you every couple seconds. They will come faster as the game progresses.  You must use the SPACE key to shoot.  If the bullet hits the zombie, the zombie is dead.  He disappears.

If a zombie hits you, you have lost.

To move up or down, use the up and down arrow keys, or for touchscreen devices, simply touch the screen.

Good luck!  The zombies are harder than they seem!
